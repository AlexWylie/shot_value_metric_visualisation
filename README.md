# shot_value_metric_visualisation

## Explanation

The Shot Value metric - otherwise named Expected Goals - is a metric that I created to evaluate academy football players and teams. The data was created using SportsCode: https://www.hudl.com/elite/sportscode. However, the data has been omitted to protect the identities of the players.

The metric was created using a multiple logistic regression model, which incorporated spatial and descriptive independent variables.

I have included additional R scripts that were used to evaluate and visualise the metric.

The pitch plot was copied/modified from here: https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer
